<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is an idea I got when I was attending a local high school football tournament. While in the NBA or any other big league matches, there is often an app to complement the tournament. This is a place where you can see matches, teams, stats, etc... I decided to build a web app that local high schools can adapt to their tournaments, where they can manage: tournaments, matches, teams and players.

### Built With

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Nodejs](https://www.mysql.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1) Download the project files and install node-modules for the front end and back end. 

2) Create identical database in MySQL using queries in the included createDatabase.sql file.

3) Update connection settings in server.js file in backend for the database.

4) Start up both the backend and client servers, and start innovating!
   
## Future Tasks

1. Host server on Microsoft Azure and prep project for Heroku deployment
2. Improve user authentication with OAuth 2.0
